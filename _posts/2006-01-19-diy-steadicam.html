<p>While poking around looking at some photography stuff, I found a nice way to make your own steadicam at <a href="http://www.jasonbradbury.com/jason_bradbury/2005/11/diy_steadicam_c.html">http://www.jasonbradbury.com/jason_bradbury/2005/11/diy_steadicam_c.html</a></p>
<p>It's pretty nice since it uses a monopod and tripod that are fairly easy to find, and the whole thing saves you bundles from getting a "real" steadicam.</p>
