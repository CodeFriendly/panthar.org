<p>I was reading an article over at Lifehacker about different blogging clients, and I ran into one I remember seeing a while back, "Performancing".&nbsp; Performancing is an extension for Firefox, and lets the user choose between WYSIWYG and HTML editing of posts.&nbsp; I also noticed that Performancing also seems to be a company that provides blog metrics.&nbsp; The stats seem to be able to show posts, comments, views, and a whole slew of other information.&nbsp; I have signed up to try out this service over at <a href="http://performancing.com/">http://performancing.com/</a> and hopefully I will see some nice statistics soon.&nbsp; And, I can see how their editor works for me.</p>
