<p>I just got the strangest newsletter from Mozy. The guy that runs the company seemed to be a tad bit off in this very "professional" blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the nice things about being an ugly American is that I make all sorts of ignorant and culturally insensitive remarks about other countries. And as luck would have it, I had that opportunity last week when I visited Montreal. (That&rsquo;s in Canada.)<br />
The first thing I noticed about Montreal is that it&rsquo;s a very clean city - like Toronto in that respect. Oh wait - actually, the first thing I noticed was the streets were on fire and full of police and rioting citizens because I guess they won an O-KAY (that&rsquo;s hockey) game. My flight got in late that night and the taxi driver had to change his routes because the streets were blocked off by police.<br />
Other observations I had were related to confusing things like French-speaking people with the Queen of England on their money and the lack of $1 bills in their currency. Also, the whole &ldquo;Canadians burned the White House down in 1814? makes me sad inside, but I guess that was a long time ago.<br />
Be Safe,<br />
