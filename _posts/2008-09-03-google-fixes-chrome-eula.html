<p>Looks like Google has been getting a lot of comments about its Chrome browser's EULA. They are now in the process of fixing the Content Licensing clause of the EULA.</p>
<p>Apparently, they reused the same wording they used in most of their online services, but this didn't make much sense for a browser product.Â  So, they are fixing that particular clause so your dirty internet habits do not become property of Google.</p>
