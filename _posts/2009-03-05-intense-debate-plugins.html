<p>I am using the Intense Debate plugin to manage comments on this blog, and they have just released plugins. You can see a list of the current ones here: <a title="http://www.intensedebate.com/plugins/" href="http://www.intensedebate.com/plugins/">http://www.intensedebate.com/plugins/</a></p>
<p>For this post, I think I will try out the Polls plugin.Â  Vote away!</p>
