<p>Adam over at <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> just wrote up an excellent guide on using Launchy for more than just... launching.  Using a few batch files, Launchy can do some pretty amazing tricks similar to Quicksilver on the Mac.</p>
<p>The tricks in this article include using Launchy to interface with Remember the Milk, Google Calendar, and Twitter.  For everyone out there that prefers using the keyboard to manage their resources, this article is pure gold.</p>
