<p>Ever want to browse from someone else's computer - maybe at a business - and not have your browsing recorded?&nbsp; <br &#47;>Stick this little app on a USB stick and pop it into whatever computer you are using for a secure, <span style="font-style: italic;">mostly anonymous<&#47;span>*, browsing session<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.downloadsquad.com&#47;2006&#47;01&#47;26&#47;torpark-anonymous-browsing-on-a-usb-drive&#47;">TorPark: Anonymous browsing on a USB drive - Download Squad<&#47;a> <br &#47;><br &#47;>* <small><&#47;small><small><span style="font-style: italic;">I say "mostly anonymous" because if someone tries hard enough, there is usually a way to trace things.&nbsp; Of course, they would have to have access to potentially all computers using the Tor service and all records of the ISP's that serve these users. So, before you get scared at "mostly anonymous", it would take a large task force and lots of luck to trace your browsing<&#47;span><&#47;small><br &#47;><br />
