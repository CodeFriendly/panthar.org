<p>I am working on getting the Plurk boxes rounded to look a little nicer.  I have some early CSS written up that almost works, but I am having a hard time making the right hand border line up when a plurk is expanded. I think it has to do with that width being dynamically hard-coded. Yes, that sounds a bit odd, but it's basically on page load, the plurk code sets a static width on the expanded box.</p>
<p>So, I am looking into fun tricks like negative margins and/or padding, but not having too much luck so far.  For anyone that wants to use what I have so far, here is the CSS ( it also includes a piece to round your dashboard):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#plurk-dashboard  {

color: #ffffff;
margin: 0 5px;
padding: 10px;
border: 2px solid #ffffff;
-moz-border-radius: 6px;
-khtml-border-radius: 6px;
-webkit-border-radius: 6px;
border-radius: 6px;
}

.plurk_cnt  {
border: 1px solid #000000;
-moz-border-radius: 3px;
-khtml-border-radius: 3px;
-webkit-border-radius: 3px;
border-radius: 3px;
}

#form_holder
{
border-right: 1px solid #000000;
border-left: 1px solid #000000;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
