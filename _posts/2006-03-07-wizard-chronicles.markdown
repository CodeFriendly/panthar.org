excerpt: My new toy, an HTC Wizard (disguised as a QTEK 9100) just started its journey
  on a large brown plane from CA (why does it scare me that one way to pronounce UPS
  is "oops"?).

<p>Hopefully I'll have a nice new <strike>toy<&#47;strike> productivity tool to <strike>play with<&#47;strike> set up this weekend.  I've been waiting for a nice combination of a PDA&#47;phone, and so far, none of the offerings appealed to me.  Treo, Blackberry.. they were all pretty darn close, but this is exactly what I have been looking for.</p>
