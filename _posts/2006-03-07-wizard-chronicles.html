<p><a class="imagelink" title="QTEK 9100" onclick="doPopup(76);return false;" href="http://panthar.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/Qtek_9100.jpg"><img align="left" style="width: 137px; height: 127px" title="QTEK 9100" id="image76" alt="QTEK 9100" src="assets/Qtek_9100.jpg" /></a>My new toy, an HTC Wizard (disguised as a QTEK 9100) just started its journey on a large brown plane from CA (why does it scare me that one way to pronounce UPS is "oops"?).</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll have a nice new <strike>toy</strike> productivity tool to <strike>play with</strike> set up this weekend.  I've been waiting for a nice combination of a PDA/phone, and so far, none of the offerings appealed to me.  Treo, Blackberry.. they were all pretty darn close, but this is exactly what I have been looking for.</p>
