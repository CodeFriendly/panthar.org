<p>I have been using 30Boxes (excellent online calendar) and EvokeTV for a while now.  I don't watch a whole lot of TV, so it is nice to have a simple television listing web app that quickly shows listings and details about shows.  It is also very easy to mark shows as favorites, rate them, etc.  The shows that I actually watch are accessible in a nice RSS feed now, which can easily be subscribed to in 30Boxes.</p>
<p>Now, after I pick the shows I like using Evoke, I can just go to 30Boxes and they show up in my schedule.   Now if there was a way for subscribed events to show up in the RSS or ICS files to allow subscription from a local application/PDA/etc, it would be perfect.  If there is already a way to do that, let me know in the comments!</p>
