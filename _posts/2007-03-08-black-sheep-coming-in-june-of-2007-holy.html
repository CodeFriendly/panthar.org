<p>Okay, this is the weirdest movie trailer I have seen in a LONG time.  First, the description of the movie:</p>
<p>"<em>On a vast New Zealand sheep station, a reckless genetic engineering experiment goes horribly wrong, turning sheep into bloodthirsty killers</em>."</p>
<p>Now, if the description isn't strange enough for you, check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Post in the comments how far your jaw dropped!</p>
