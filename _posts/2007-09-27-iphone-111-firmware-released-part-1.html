<p>iTunes just informed me that the 1.1.1 firmware is out for the iPhone.  Here are the changes from the release notes:</p>
<p>• iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store<br />
• Louder speakerphone and receiver volume<br />
• Home Button double-click shortcut to phone favorites or music controls<br />
• Space bar double-tap shortcut to intelligently insert period and space<br />
• Mail attachments are viewable in portrait and landscape<br />
• Stocks and cities in Stocks and Weather can be re-ordered<br />
• Apple Bluetooth Headset battery status in the Status Bar<br />
• Support for TV Out<br />
• Preference to turn off EDGE/GPRS when roaming internationally<br />
• New Passcode lock time intervals<br />
• Adjustable alert volume.</p>
<p>I'm installing it right now, and will see how it plays with my third-party apps.</p>
