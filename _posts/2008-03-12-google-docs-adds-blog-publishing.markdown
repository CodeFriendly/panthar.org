<p>Here's a little something that seems to have snuck into Google Docs - publishing to a Blog!  Create a document in Google Docs (like this one right here), click on the "<strong>Publish<&#47;strong>" tab on the top right corner, and on the bottom, you should see a "<strong>Post to Blog<&#47;strong>" button. You might have to enter your blog settings, but this is quick and easy. Within seconds, you should have a new entry on your blog!<br />
So if you like to take your time and write drafts of blog posts, or just have the formatting&#47;spellchecking&#47;etc tools that are available in a word processor, this might be a great new way for you to post to your blog.</p>
