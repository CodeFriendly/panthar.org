<p>Looks like another  yet another botnet is building up from a trojan being sent around as "Postcard.exe".  I followed the botnet to a new channel, and they have almost 450 clients there. Most of those seem to be clients fired off from the trojan.  Hopefully, the Undernet admins can stop this one for now. Yes, I know that another one will pop right up, but since this particular beast is coded to join certain channels, maybe it will give helpless attachment-clickers a little bit of a break.</p>
