<p>I was reading an article over at Lifehacker about different blogging clients, and I ran into one I remember seeing a while back, "Performancing".&nbsp; Performancing is an extension for Firefox, and lets the user choose between WYSIWYG and HTML editing of posts.&nbsp; I also noticed that Performancing also seems to be a company that provides blog metrics.&nbsp; The stats seem to be able to show posts, comments, views, and a whole slew of other information.&nbsp; I have signed up to try out this service over at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;performancing.com&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;performancing.com&#47;<&#47;a> and hopefully I will see some nice statistics soon.&nbsp; And, I can see how their editor works for me.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Technorati Tags: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;technorati.com&#47;tag&#47;technology" rel="tag">technology<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;technorati.com&#47;tag&#47;blogging" rel="tag">blogging<&#47;a></p>
